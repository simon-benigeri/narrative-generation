C: (joy): But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
R: (neutral): How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her.  But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.

He sticks it his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds th match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.

He sticks the card in the flowers - turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to flowers.  There's a knock at the door.

C: (anger): And...action! Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddi suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away, backing out of Eddie's reach.
R: (anger): Bad last moment - I cut that out. Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie' left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standin and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor. Oleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pin him to the wall. Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the ch repeatedly. Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table a onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa. Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the ch in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it i not clear in the darkness who has the gun. Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp. Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to tu toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him the stomach. Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S STOMACH. Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting close up. Emil looks at Eddie.

You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming.  It would be only normal to ask, why?

One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. The restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch.

R: (anger): Whatever's leftover, keep. Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled wit rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets u and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.

C: (fear): ...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill! Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Ma the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here?  Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird g in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to othe cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cu continues:
R: (anger): ...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future. They are through the monuments, approaching the steps whe Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his wa obsessively.
