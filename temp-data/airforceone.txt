C: (joy): Roger, Restitution.  We are standing  by for delivery.
R: (neutral): The SOUNDS of a dinner banquet.   Forks clanking against plates and  the din of a hundred conversations,  broken by...
---
C: (fear): We've already been inspected.
R: (neutral): Sir, this plane carries the President  of the United States.
---
C: (joy): *                     CBS said they'll  give us four minutes.  They thought  the Russian was a nice touch.
R: (neutral): I always wondered if my freshman  Russian class would come in handy.
---
C: (neutral): I always wondered if my freshman  Russian class would come in handy.
R: (anger): Sir, you threw out page two.
---
C: (anger): Sir, you threw out page two.
R: (anger): Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a  tough-as-nails speech and you gave  me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the  point in having a speech if I have  to ad-lib?
---
C: (anger): Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a  tough-as-nails speech and you gave  me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the  point in having a speech if I have  to ad-lib?
R: (joy): It was a good ad-lib, sir.
---
C: (joy): It was a good ad-lib, sir.
R: (neutral): Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
---
C: (joy): Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally  meet you in person.
R: (joy): The President and I were delighted  that we could accommodate you.  Now  if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
---
C: (neutral): You wanna knock of f?
R: (joy): No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the  Speaker say?
---
C: (joy): No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the  Speaker say?
R: (anger): He and the NRA don't like the wording.
---
C: (anger): He and the NRA don't like the wording.
R: (neutral): Apparently taking uzis away from  sixth graders isn't as popular as we  thought it'd be.  Representative  Taylor is working on a compromise.
---
C: (neutral): Apparently taking uzis away from  sixth graders isn't as popular as we  thought it'd be.  Representative  Taylor is working on a compromise.
R: (joy): Put together a score sheet.  I'll  make some calls.
---
C: (joy): Put together a score sheet.  I'll  make some calls.
R: (sadness): With all due respect, sir, maybe you  should give them this one.  Your  numbers are still pretty low and you  called in a lot of chips to nail  Stravanavitch.
---
C: (sadness): With all due respect, sir, maybe you  should give them this one.  Your  numbers are still pretty low and you  called in a lot of chips to nail  Stravanavitch.
R: (neutral): I might still have a few chips left.
---
C: (neutral): I might still have a few chips left.
R: (neutral): *                     We could always  put you in a duck blind with a twelve  gauge.  The second amendment types'll  love that.
---
C: (neutral): *                     We could always  put you in a duck blind with a twelve  gauge.  The second amendment types'll  love that.
R: (anger): This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing  a couple ducks won't get it through  committee.  Besides, Shep, I told  you...  I don't shoot babies and I  don't kiss guns.
---
C: (anger): This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing  a couple ducks won't get it through  committee.  Besides, Shep, I told  you...  I don't shoot babies and I  don't kiss guns.
R: (neutral): Other way around, sir.
---
C: (neutral): Other way around, sir.
R: (neutral): Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a  favor and keep me away from the press.
---
C: (neutral): This is the part I wanted you to  see.
R: (sadness): Criminal.  One of our boys died in  Marshall's little publicity stunt  and for what?  So we could claim  victory over another country's  problems instead of our own?  And  now he's got the nerve to prance  around Moscow gloating, while that  poor boy's family is left to bury  him.  If I were Marshall, I'd be  ashamed of myself.

R: (anger): There you have it.  Harsh words for  the President from Michael Danforth,  the Speaker of the House.
---
C: (anger): It's bait.  Don't take it.
R: (anger): Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked  this administration on national  television.  You can't afford to  leave that hanging.

C: (neutral): Did we tape the Duke game?
R: (neutral): It's waiting on the plane.  The ending  was pretty...
---
C: (neutral): It's waiting on the plane.  The ending  was pretty...
R: (surprise): Please don't tell me.  Just for once,  *                     let me be  surprised.
---
C: (joy): Up on the upper deck is the cockpit  and the Mission Communication Center.   The MCC, as we call it, can place  clear and secure phone calls to  anywhere on earth.  We're linked to  a network of military and civilian  satellites and ground stations.  We  could run the country or run a war  from there if we had to.
R: (neutral): This is a remarkable aircraft.
---
C: (neutral): This is a remarkable aircraft.
R: (fear): You don't know the half of it.  Did  you know this entire plane is shielded  from radiation?  We could fly through  a mushroom cloud completely unharmed  if necessary.
---
C: (fear): You don't know the half of it.  Did  you know this entire plane is shielded  from radiation?  We could fly through  a mushroom cloud completely unharmed  if necessary.
R: (fear): A dubious distinction, no?
---
C: (fear): A dubious distinction, no?
R: (neutral): I guess it depends on your  perspective.
---
C: (neutral): And all these rooms here?
R: (neutral): Conference rooms, though some have  other functions.  The one up front  doubles as an emergency medical  center.
---
C: (joy): Here's a press kit.  I'll let you  guys get comfortable and once we're  airborne I'll be able to schedule  the interviews.
R: (joy): Thank you.
---
C: (joy): You fellas win some sort of fly-with- POTUS contest?
R: (neutral): Potus?  What is Potus?

C: (neutral): Potus?  What is Potus?
R: (neutral): P.O.T.U.S. President Of The United  States.
---
C: (neutral): P.O.T.U.S. President Of The United  States.
R: (neutral): Ah, no.  We won nothing.  We are  ITAR-TASS news service.
---
C: (neutral): Ah, no.  We won nothing.  We are  ITAR-TASS news service.
R: (anger): Right.  Listen, this here... This is  my row.  You'll have to sit over  there.

C: (joy): Welcome aboard, Mr. President.
R: (joy): Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?
---
C: (joy): Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?
R: (neutral): Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?
---
C: (neutral): Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?
R: (neutral): You keep offering, one of these days  I'll take you up on it.  Rose and Alice back yet?
---
C: (neutral): You keep offering, one of these days  I'll take you up on it.  Rose and Alice back yet?
R: (neutral): No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran  late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.
---
C: (anger): I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
R: (sadness): We'll just say it was in bad taste.
---
C: (anger): You give me ulcers.
R: (joy): That's my job.
---
C: (neutral): Mr. President?
R: (neutral): Hey Mike.  Could you get me a  Heineken?
---
C: (neutral): Hey Mike.  Could you get me a  Heineken?
R: (neutral): No, wait.  Get him one of the Russian  beers.
---
C: (joy): Yes, Mr. President.
R: (neutral): I don't believe this.  I'm playing  politics with a bottle of beer.  A  goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been  in office too long.
---
C: (neutral): I don't believe this.  I'm playing  politics with a bottle of beer.  A  goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been  in office too long.
R: (joy): Look on the bright side... if the  polls don't change, you won't have  that problem, sir.
---
C: (anger): Defense and State Department in the  conference room in one hour.  I want  to review the Iraq situation.
R: (joy): Yes, sir.
---
C: (neutral): It's not like he hasn't made us wait  a few times.
R: (neutral): Well, you aren't the President, dear.
---
C: (neutral): Well, you aren't the President, dear.
R: (neutral): Yeah, no duh.
---
C: (neutral): You don't want to say hi to your  father?
R: (joy): I'm sure he's busy.
---
C: (joy): I'm sure he's busy.
R: (neutral): Don't you even want to ask?
---
C: (joy): Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double  whip cream.
R: (neutral): Alice...
---
C: (neutral): Alice...
R: (joy): Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
---
C: (joy): Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
R: (neutral): You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about  this back...
---
C: (neutral): You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about  this back...
R: (neutral): Back at The Fishbowl?
---
C: (joy): We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky  as you.  For most girls seeing the  Bolshoi ballet would be the experience  of a lifetime.
R: (neutral): I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
---
C: (neutral): He's in a meeting.  He can't be  disturbed.
R: (sadness): I'm sorry, honey.
---
C: (sadness): I'm sorry, honey.
R: (joy): No, it's okay.  After all, he is the  President, right?
---
C: (joy): When I write my memoirs I think I'll  devote an entire chapter to the cocoa  aboard Air Force One.
R: (neutral): Your father never means to be so...
---
C: (neutral): Your father never means to be so...
R: (neutral): I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me  versus the world.  Some kid at school  teases me and the same day a plague  breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it  doesn't take a genius to figure which  is more important.
---
C: (neutral): I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me  versus the world.  Some kid at school  teases me and the same day a plague  breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it  doesn't take a genius to figure which  is more important.
R: (neutral): Some kids were teasing you?
---
C: (neutral): Some kids were teasing you?
R: (neutral): That's not really the point.
---
C: (joy): You're right and I'll tell you a  secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
R: (neutral): Big secret.  You said the same thing  to Newsweek.
---
C: (joy): Oooooh, I'm good.
R: (neutral): Hey, you guys back already?
---
C: (joy): How was...  ...the ballet?
R: (neutral): It was the experience of a lifetime.
---
C: (neutral): It was the experience of a lifetime.
R: (neutral): How `bout a hug for the old man.
---
C: (joy): Mr. President... they're ready for  you in the conference room.
R: (joy): Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me  all about it later, right?
---
C: (joy): Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me  all about it later, right?
R: (joy): Sure.
---
C: (joy): May I speak to you for a moment?
R: (neutral): Can't it wait?
---
C: (neutral): Can't it wait?
R: (neutral): No, Mr. President.  It can't.
---
C: (joy): Don't.  I know spin control when I  feel it.
R: (neutral): Rose, I don't have time for this.
---
C: (neutral): For godsakes, Jim, slow down and  stop acting like the little dutch  boy.  Not even you can plug all the  world's leaks.  Don't you think it's  a sign you're pushing too hard when  your daughter sees more of you on  MTV news than in person.
R: (joy): She's a big girl.  She understands.
---
C: (joy): She's a big girl.  She understands.
R: (joy): How do you know she understands?   You haven't spent more than five  minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
---
C: (joy): How do you know she understands?   You haven't spent more than five  minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
R: (anger): And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and  I'm already three hours behind  Schedule.  What do you want me to  do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off  because I'm a family man?I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.
---
C: (anger): And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and  I'm already three hours behind  Schedule.  What do you want me to  do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off  because I'm a family man?I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.
R: (neutral): No. It wasn't.
---
C: (neutral): You know what?
R: (fear): What?
---
C: (fear): What?
R: (sadness): I miss you. And I miss her.
---
C: (sadness): I miss you. And I miss her.
R: (joy): But that's the point, Jim. We're                      right here.
---
C: (joy): But that's the point, Jim. We're                      right here.
R: (joy): I wish it were that easy...
---
C: (joy): I'll make it up to you, I promise.
R: (neutral): I should trust that promise? Because  you know the voters are still waiting  for that middle class tax cut.
---
C: (neutral): I should trust that promise? Because  you know the voters are still waiting  for that middle class tax cut.
R: (neutral): This promise isn't subject to  Congressional approval.
---
C: (neutral): How did your speech go?
R: (joy): Well, they aren't burning me in  effigy. That's always a good sign.
---
C: (joy): Look on the bright side, hon. Shep  here thinks I'll be a one termer.
R: (fear): Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to  schedule your daughter in?
---
C: (fear): Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to  schedule your daughter in?
R: (neutral): She is scheduled. Her school play's  Tuesday night.
---
C: (joy): United States Air Force One, this is  tower. It's an honor to clear you  for immediate take-off on runway  three.
R: (joy): Roger, Tower. And thank you for the  hospitality.
---
C: (neutral): Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100  hours. What you see here is the  mobilization of two mechanized  brigades.
R: (joy): They've gotta be joking.
---
C: (joy): They've gotta be joking.
R: (anger): The Iraqi ambassador is claiming  it's just an exercise.
---
C: (anger): The Iraqi ambassador is claiming  it's just an exercise.
R: (anger): An exercise in futility. Send the  Nimitz back in.
---
C: (anger): An exercise in futility. Send the  Nimitz back in.
R: (neutral): The northern border's gotten a bit  hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag  with our Tomcats and our boys are  just itching to engage.
---
C: (neutral): The northern border's gotten a bit  hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag  with our Tomcats and our boys are  just itching to engage.
R: (neutral): Tell our boys to cool their jets. I  don't need `em creating policy for  me.
---
C: (joy): Air Force One Heavy, acknowledged. You are on our scope. Please state  fuel remaining and souls onboard.
R: (joy): Sixty seven souls onboard, we're  okay with fuel. Request secure  military escort with emergency medical  standing by.
---
C: (joy): Sixty seven souls onboard, we're  okay with fuel. Request secure  military escort with emergency medical  standing by.
R: (fear): Air Force One Heavy, acknowledged. We are scrambling our fighters.
---
C: (fear): What's going on?
R: (fear): We're under attack.
---
C: (fear): We're under attack.
R: (neutral): Where's my family?
---
C: (neutral): Where's my family?
R: (neutral): We're handling it, sir.
---
C: (neutral): Warsaw Tower has cleared local  airspace.
R: (fear): Changing course heading to 276 point  five. Dropping to twenty thousand  feet.
---
C: (fear): Ingrahams, make sure that door's  locked.
R: (joy): Yes sir.
---
C: (neutral): We have Boy Scout, traveling forward.
R: (neutral): Negative... negative... they're up  here too.
---
C: (neutral): Negative... negative... they're up  here too.
R: (neutral): Roger. We're going to the chute.
---
C: (neutral): Alice!
R: (neutral): Daddy...
---
C: (neutral): Air Force One, this is Squadron  Commander Canton. You are now under  escort. All airspace has been cleared.
R: (anger): This is Air Force One Heavy. I'm  coming in full throttle. ETA to  Ranstein eight minutes. We've got a  war here, sir.
---
C: (neutral): What about my family?
R: (joy): I have a family, too, sir. Now get  in the fucking pod.
---
C: (neutral): One.
R: (fear): But...
---
C: (fear): But...
R: (neutral): Two... THREE. GO!
---
C: (neutral): Ramstein/Air Force One: Emergency  pod has been deployed. I repeat,  emergency pod has been deployed.
R: (joy): This is Ramstein. Acknowledged. We  are picking up the homing beacon and  deploying search and rescue.
---
C: (joy): This is Ramstein. Acknowledged. We  are picking up the homing beacon and  deploying search and rescue.
R: (neutral): Copy Ramstein. We are dropping to  five thousand feet, beginning final  approach.
---
C: (anger): in his path. A monstrous plane, every  bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs  eases back on the wheel and the 747  sluggishly responds, its nose creeping  upward.
R: (neutral): Come on.
---
C: (neutral): Okay, 30,000 feet. Give me my heading.
R: (neutral): Bearing 110 point eight two.
---
C: (neutral): Call me if something changes.
R: (neutral): That's it?
---
C: (neutral): That's it?
R: (neutral): To fly a 747 you need to know three  things. How to take of f, how to  land, and how to engage the autopilot.
---
C: (fear): The rest of the secret service?
R: (sadness): Dead.
---
C: (sadness): Dead.
R: (neutral): How many others killed?
---
C: (neutral): How many others killed?
R: (neutral): Nine.

C: (neutral): Nine.
R: (neutral): Any of us?

C: (anger): No damages.
R: (neutral): Where's my daughter?
---
C: (neutral): Where's my daughter?
R: (joy): She's alive, ma'am, for the time  being.
---
C: (neutral): And my husband?
R: (neutral): The secret service did their job,  ma'am. The President is safely off  the plane.  But that still leaves us plenty to  bargain with.
---
C: (neutral): General Greely says it looks like  the Middle East.
R: (joy): Does your office have anything to  add, Mr. Dean?
---
C: (fear): Our only policy assumes the plane is  on the ground. Our hands are  completely tied while they're in the  air.
R: (neutral): Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action  until we confirm that the president  is off the plane... Lee, go huddle  with the D.O.D. I want an options  paper on this in 20 minutes.
---
C: (neutral): Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action  until we confirm that the president  is off the plane... Lee, go huddle  with the D.O.D. I want an options  paper on this in 20 minutes.
R: (neutral): Twenty minutes?

C: (neutral): Twenty minutes?
R: (neutral): You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.

C: (neutral): National Command Authority. All  previous launch codes have been  cancelled. You're carrying the ball  now.
R: (joy): Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.
---
C: (neutral): No sir. I just wish...
R: (neutral): Roger. We all wish... Now shut the  fuck up and escort.
---
C: (fear): Fear will keep you alive. Any one  who is not afraid is bound to do  something foolish, and bound to die.
R: (neutral): What do you want with us?
---
C: (neutral): What do you want with us?
R: (neutral): Cooperation. If you try to escape,  you will be met with automatic gunfire  and a barricade of your comrade's  bodies will prevent you from exiting.  Good day.
---
C: (anger): This can't be happening. You just  don't pull this shit with the United  States. You just don't.
R: (joy): Keep your heads.
---
C: (joy): Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?
R: (joy): We're alive.
---
C: (joy): We're alive.
R: (joy): That's all that matters. Thank god  the President got of f the plane.
---
C: (joy): That's all that matters. Thank god  the President got of f the plane.
R: (joy): Yes... thank God.  You there... Caidwell, right? What's  on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat,  then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.
---
C: (joy): Yes... thank God.  You there... Caidwell, right? What's  on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat,  then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.
R: (joy): I don't want to get anybody here  excited, but if we can get out of  this room, I can get us to safety.
---
C: (joy): I don't want to get anybody here  excited, but if we can get out of  this room, I can get us to safety.
R: (neutral): We're thirty five thousand feet up.
---
C: (neutral): We're thirty five thousand feet up.
R: (neutral): Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if  we can somehow get to a lower  altitude, the rear loading ramp on  the baggage deck is equipped with  parachutes in case of an engine  failure. Now we can either wait for  a political resolution, or try to  resolve this thing ourselves.
---
C: (neutral): Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if  we can somehow get to a lower  altitude, the rear loading ramp on  the baggage deck is equipped with  parachutes in case of an engine  failure. Now we can either wait for  a political resolution, or try to  resolve this thing ourselves.
R: (joy): You're goddamn right we can resolve  this ourselves. We'll negotiate.
---
C: (joy): You're goddamn right we can resolve  this ourselves. We'll negotiate.
R: (neutral): You know the President's policy.
---
C: (neutral): You know the President's policy.
R: (neutral): The President isn't here.
---
C: (neutral): The President isn't here.
R: (neutral): Right now we are an enormous liability  to the United States. We can't just  sit and do nothing.
---
C: (neutral): Madame Vice-President, we just got  word from Ramstein... The nod was  UntiL Chandler stands.
R: (sadness): Empty?
---
C: (sadness): Empty?
R: (neutral): The President... he must still be  onboard.
---
C: (neutral): The President... he must still be  onboard.
R: (joy): Play back that call.
---
C: (joy): Play back that call.
R: (joy): Yes, sir.
---
C: (neutral): The plane is under our command, and  those we did not kill we hold as  hostages, including the Chief of  Staff, the First Lady, and the First  Daughter.
R: (neutral): but not the President. Not the  President.
---
C: (sadness): He's dead then. They must have killed  him.
R: (neutral): We don't know that.
---
C: (neutral): We don't know that.
R: (anger): Holding the president hostage is not  something that slips your mind when  you're making demands.
---
C: (anger): Holding the president hostage is not  something that slips your mind when  you're making demands.
R: (fear): And if he's dead? Do you really think  they'd risk telling us?
---
C: (fear): And if he's dead? Do you really think  they'd risk telling us?
R: (fear): There is a possibility we're  overlooking.
---
C: (neutral): Walter, if you have a point, make  it.
R: (neutral): That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
---
C: (neutral): So what are you saying?
R: (neutral): Maybe he's alive on that plane and  those bastards don't even know it.
---
C: (neutral): Maybe he's alive on that plane and  those bastards don't even know it.
R: (neutral): Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the  President is not 19 anymore.
---
C: (neutral): Madame Vice president. We have an  options paper.  chandler takes the  options paper, waves off Lee, and  reads it as she talks.
R: (joy): Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
---
C: (joy): Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
R: (neutral): But I will deploy forces to a staging  area near the Turkmenistan border.  When you have more information, we  can decide how to proceed.
---
C: (neutral): But I will deploy forces to a staging  area near the Turkmenistan border.  When you have more information, we  can decide how to proceed.
R: (joy): By then I'll be President.
---
C: (neutral): Can we do that?
R: (fear): We've got four hours before they  make it into Turkienistan airspace.
---
C: (neutral): But they start executing hostages in
R: (neutral): I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll  sacrifice pawns before kings. It may  take them some time to kill their  way up to senior staff.
---
C: (neutral): I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll  sacrifice pawns before kings. It may  take them some time to kill their  way up to senior staff.
R: (neutral): Okay. Also, I want you to put our  bases in Turkey on alert, and have  the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory  air strike.
---
C: (neutral): No... I got the new numbers from our  gamers. They believe that there's  only an eight percent chance that  the President is still alive.
R: (joy): Eight percent is better than zero.
---
C: (neutral): Would someone get the Press Secretary!
R: (neutral): He's been holding on line four.
---
C: (anger): Who did this?
R: (joy): We checked the manifest. Everyone  was accounted for.
---
C: (joy): We checked the manifest. Everyone  was accounted for.
R: (neutral): A secret service agent. It must be.
---
C: (neutral): Now, or he dies, please.
R: (neutral): Come on, Alice.
---
C: (neutral): Come on, Alice.
R: (fear): I'm scared.
---
C: (joy): Information. How can I assist you?
R: (fear): Washington D.C.?
---
C: (fear): Washington D.C.?
R: (joy): Yes, sir. Can I help you?

C: (joy): Yes, sir. Can I help you?
R: (neutral): Yes, the number for the White House.

C: (anger): I don't drink coffee.
R: (sadness): You must be tired. It'll wake you  up.
---
C: (sadness): You must be tired. It'll wake you  up.
R: (anger): No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
---
C: (sadness): Leave my daughter alone.
R: (joy): Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your  husband, on the other hand...
---
C: (joy): Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your  husband, on the other hand...
R: (neutral): What do you know of my husband?
---
C: (neutral): What do you know of my husband?
R: (sadness): I know he left you behind.
---
C: (sadness): I know he left you behind.
R: (joy): My husband is a very courageous man.
---
C: (joy): My husband is a very courageous man.
R: (anger): Your husband is a coward. He sends  soldiers half-way around the world  to steal a man from his home in the  middle of the night.
---
C: (neutral): You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
R: (joy): So, you study world events, little  one. That's good for a girl your  age.
---
C: (joy): So, you study world events, little  one. That's good for a girl your  age.
R: (anger): Yeah, I study world events. Five  thousand Turkienistan Muslims were  slaughtered in Stravanvitch's  cleansings... along with 15 American  school kids. You know hQw I studied  that. I went to their funerals with  my dad. I met their parents.
---
C: (anger): Yeah, I study world events. Five  thousand Turkienistan Muslims were  slaughtered in Stravanvitch's  cleansings... along with 15 American  school kids. You know hQw I studied  that. I went to their funerals with  my dad. I met their parents.
R: (joy): Smart for your age, eh? Top of your  class? Tell me, do you know what the  word "propaganda" means?
---
C: (joy): Smart for your age, eh? Top of your  class? Tell me, do you know what the  word "propaganda" means?
R: (neutral): Yeah. Do you know what the word  "asshole" means.

C: (neutral): Yeah. Do you know what the word  "asshole" means.
R: (neutral): Alice!
---
C: (joy): White House switchboard. How may I  direct your call.
R: (neutral): Okay listen, listen carefully. This  is an emergency call from Air Force  One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
---
C: (neutral): who can I say is calling?
R: (anger): This is the President.
---
C: (anger): This is the President.
R: (joy): Yeah, right.

C: (joy): Yeah, right.
R: (fear): Don't cut me off. This is an  emergency.
---
C: (fear): Don't cut me off. This is an  emergency.
R: (neutral): Sir, the President does not call  this particular number. So whoever  you are get a life, before I have  this call traced.
---
C: (neutral): Sir, the President does not call  this particular number. So whoever  you are get a life, before I have  this call traced.
R: (neutral): You don't understand. This is an  emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
---
C: (joy): Okay... if you're the President,  when's your wife's birthday?
R: (neutral): Look lady, I don't have time for  games. Just put the....
---
C: (neutral): Look lady, I don't have time for  games. Just put the....
R: (joy): Thank you for calling the white  House...
---
C: (neutral): On your knees...
R: (joy): Hello. Is anyone there?
---
C: (neutral): My intention is not to escalate the  situation, but it's a contigency  that must be considered. Hang on...  What?
R: (anger): The switchboard says that someone  called in claiming to be the  President, then she heard gunfire.
---
C: (anger): Could be some crank watching CNN.
R: (neutral): No sir. Trace confirms the call is  Coming from a White House staff  cellular account.
---
C: (neutral): No sir. Trace confirms the call is  Coming from a White House staff  cellular account.
R: (joy): Put it through down here.  Hang on, Toni.
---
C: (joy): It's him. He is alive.
R: (neutral): I'm going to take your weapon now,  and then I'm going to take you  Upstairs to join the others.
---
C: (joy): Christ, they have him.
R: (fear): And if you make any sudden moves, I  will not hesitate to shoot.
---
C: (fear): And if you make any sudden moves, I  will not hesitate to shoot.
R: (neutral): Maybe they don't have him yet.
---
C: (neutral): General Greely, Air Force One has  automatic countermeasures, right?
R: (joy): Everything we own is in that plane.
---
C: (joy): Everything we own is in that plane.
R: (anger): So a single missile launched from a  distance should be a mere distraction.
---
C: (anger): So a single missile launched from a  distance should be a mere distraction.
R: (fear): Theoretically.
---
C: (fear): Theoretically.
R: (neutral): Ramutein Tower Control, please.
---
C: (neutral): Ramutein Tower Control, please.
R: (fear): But the effect could be jarring.
---
C: (fear): But the effect could be jarring.
R: (neutral): Exactly. Ramstein? General  Northwood... Patch me through to  your fighters. Madame Vice  President... with your permission?
---
C: (neutral): Exactly. Ramstein? General  Northwood... Patch me through to  your fighters. Madame Vice  President... with your permission?
R: (joy): Do it.
---
C: (sadness): You'll suffer for what you've done.
R: (neutral): *                    So will you.
---
C: (neutral): You will walk ahead... slowly. Do  you understand?  Do you understand!
R: (fear): Do you know what's going to happen  to you because of this? Do you know  what the world will do?
---
C: (fear): Do you know what's going to happen  to you because of this? Do you know  what the world will do?
R: (neutral): Nothing. The world will do nothing.
---
C: (anger): You want me to what?
R: (neutral): You heard the order. And do not, I  repeat, do not take your best shot.
---
C: (neutral): You heard the order. And do not, I  repeat, do not take your best shot.
R: (joy): Roger, sir. Okay boys, clear the  deck. I have been ordered to engage  Air Force One.
---
C: (fear): Target is acquired. I have good tone  CLOSE ON: The flight stick. Carlton's  finger over the firing button. He  hesitates.
R: (neutral): They're gonna court martial me for  this.
---
C: (neutral): What the hell's going on?
R: (anger): The Americans fired at us.
---
C: (joy): Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
R: (neutral): why did they do that?
---
C: (neutral): why did they do that?
R: (fear): Psychology. They're trying to unnerve  us.
---
C: (fear): Psychology. They're trying to unnerve  us.
R: (joy): Well it worked.
---
C: (neutral): Mom?
R: (neutral): Yes dear?
---
C: (neutral): Yes dear?
R: (anger): I'm sorry I was so mean to you  earlier.
---
C: (neutral): Did they say anything about my family?
R: (neutral): They're still alive, but the loyalists  plan to start killing hostages in  forty minutes.
---
C: (neutral): They're still alive, but the loyalists  plan to start killing hostages in  forty minutes.
R: (fear): Then tell me there's a rescue  operation underway.
---
C: (neutral): and if that means negotiating...
R: (anger): You know my policy. We don't negotiate  with terrorists. If we start now,  all of America becomes a target.
---
C: (anger): You know my policy. We don't negotiate  with terrorists. If we start now,  all of America becomes a target.
R: (neutral): But this is different, sir. You're  the President.
---
C: (neutral): Please, Mr. President. You're going  to get yourself killed. Is that your  solution?
R: (neutral): Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get  tens of thousands killed. I can't  live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected  official and the integrity of the  office of the President is infinitely  more important than the man who holds  that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as  I'm President. Is that understood?
---
C: (joy): I'm here, Mr. President.
R: (neutral): Where's the cavalry?
---
C: (neutral): Where's the cavalry?
R: (anger): We can't do anything until that plane  lands. And when it does land, sir,  it's going to be in hostile *                       territory. To be perfectly honest,  we don't know what the hell to do.
---
C: (neutral): Trapped On the baggage deck. Let me  go finish him.
R: (neutral): No. He has the advantage down there.
---
C: (neutral): *                     Please tell me  your name.
R: (fear): Maria... Maria Mitchell.
---
C: (fear): Maria... Maria Mitchell.
R: (neutral): And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
---
C: (neutral): I'm responsible for Press Relations  for the Flight Office.
R: (neutral): How are your fellow hostages feeling,  Ms. Mitchell?
---
C: (neutral): How are your fellow hostages feeling,  Ms. Mitchell?
R: (fear): Scared. We're scared.
---
C: (fear): And why are you scared?
R: (neutral): Because... because I don't want to  die.
---
C: (joy): I'll give you a few minutes to think  about that one and then we'll try  again. Perhaps soon I will choose  somebody important.
R: (joy): She was important.
---
C: (anger): Do you have to be so brutal?
R: (joy): Yes
---
C: (joy): Yes
R: (joy): Why? Do you enjoy it?
---
C: (joy): Why? Do you enjoy it?
R: (joy): I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do  what is necessary.
---
C: (joy): I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do  what is necessary.
R: (neutral): How can you? I mean they're people.
---
C: (neutral): How can you? I mean they're people.
R: (neutral): But they are not ny people. You look  at me as if I am a monster, but answer  me this -- when your planes bombed  the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry  for those dark skinned men whose  names you do not know and who's faces  You will never see? Did You cry for  their wives and children. They were  people too, yes... but they were not  your people.

R: (anger): That was war.
---
C: (anger): That was war.
R: (anger): So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little  one.
---
C: (anger): So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little  one.
R: (anger): The woman you shot. She was my friend.
---
C: (anger): The woman you shot. She was my friend.
R: (neutral): That's the way of the world, little  one. Didn't they teach you that in  school?
---
C: (neutral): Chief Mechanic, 87th Air. How can I  help you?
R: (neutral): You can talk me through an emergency  fuel dump.
---
C: (anger): They can shoot enough of us.
R: (anger): If we don't act, they'll kill US all  eventually Who's with me?
---
C: (neutral): Do you see the maintenance panel?
R: (neutral): Got it.
---
C: (neutral): Got it.
R: (neutral): Pop it open. There should be a red  switch, toggle it up.
---
C: (neutral): Pop it open. There should be a red  switch, toggle it up.
R: (neutral): Okay, it's on. We've got some  indicator lights here.
---
C: (neutral): Okay, it's on. We've got some  indicator lights here.
R: (anger): Okay, you're aerated. To dump the  fuel you have to close the circuit  for the pump. There's no switch in  Avionics so you'll have to cross the  wires. There should be five wires,  just to your left. Do you see them?
---
C: (neutral): It's cut.
R: (neutral): cross it...  The static overwhelms  the voice, then cuts out.
---
C: (neutral): cross it...  The static overwhelms  the voice, then cuts out.
R: (neutral): Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.
---
C: (fear): How?
R: (neutral): Avionics compartment! It's the only  place. You better get Zedeck down  there fast Unless, of course, you'd  rather be a martyr than a savior.
---
C: (neutral): Avionics compartment! It's the only  place. You better get Zedeck down  there fast Unless, of course, you'd  rather be a martyr than a savior.
R: (neutral): Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
---
C: (joy): He's down here. I can feel it.
R: (joy): Shut up and do your job.
---
C: (neutral): You see him?
R: (neutral): Erring on the side of caution.
---
C: (neutral): We've stopped dumping... but we've  only got about twenty minutes of  fuel left.
R: (neutral): We're not going to make it.
---
C: (neutral): We're not going to make it.
R: (anger): Not even close. Hell, we can't even  make Syria or Iraq.
---
C: (anger): Not even close. Hell, we can't even  make Syria or Iraq.
R: (neutral): Where are we now?
---
C: (neutral): Where are we now?
R: (neutral): Over the Black Sea. I can probably  get us to Turkey or Georgia.
---
C: (neutral): Over the Black Sea. I can probably  get us to Turkey or Georgia.
R: (neutral): No! If we land this plane anywhere  else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane  that flies through mushroom cloud,  evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White  House.
---
C: (joy): Finally, we can bargain.
R: (joy): I'm sure we can strike some sort of  arrangement. Land the plane and we'll  trade you hostages for fuel.
---
C: (joy): I'm sure we can strike some sort of  arrangement. Land the plane and we'll  trade you hostages for fuel.
R: (neutral): No. The plane lands when I say, or  it will crash. The hostages are  released when I say, or they will  die.
---
C: (neutral): Shall I begin by executing the  President's daughter? She's right  here.
R: (neutral): No.
---
C: (neutral): No.
R: (neutral): Say something dear.
---
C: (neutral): Say something dear.
R: (anger): Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
---
C: (anger): Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
R: (sadness): It would be a pity to squander such  a strong personality.
---
C: (neutral): We trained for months. Everything  should've gone like clockwork.
R: (anger): We have the hostages, we're getting  more fuel.
---
C: (anger): We have the hostages, we're getting  more fuel.
R: (anger): He's already killed three of us, and  we haven't even seen him. He's also  shown that he can hurt us. I need to  think.  What the hell are you doing up here?
---
C: (anger): Mr. President, how the hell did you  get on board?
R: (neutral): I never left. Where's my wife and  daughter?
---
C: (neutral): I never left. Where's my wife and  daughter?
R: (neutral): They took `em out. They're probably  on the upper deck.
---
C: (neutral): They took `em out. They're probably  on the upper deck.
R: (anger): Mr. President, Major Caldwell here  has a plan to get these hostages of  f the plane.
---
C: (anger): Mr. President, Major Caldwell here  has a plan to get these hostages of  f the plane.
R: (neutral): I dumped most of the fuel. They'll  land soon and Delta will take its  shot.
---
C: (neutral): I dumped most of the fuel. They'll  land soon and Delta will take its  shot.
R: (anger): A refueling plane is already on it's  way so we won't be landing until we  reach Turkmenistan. Your best course  of action is to release me. I will  be merciful.
---
C: (neutral): Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few  miles away. How do you propose getting  us from here to there?
R: (neutral): Gravity.
---
C: (neutral): But this one here, see this. It's a  satellite dish and it wasn't there  two weeks ago. Basic communications  uplink, which suggests extensive  communicatins ability. I'd say this  was the one.
R: (joy): Are you confident you can take the  facility?
---
C: (joy): Are you confident you can take the  facility?
R: (joy): It's night there for a few more hours.  That's a real plus. But I won't lie.  As far as special ops go, this one's  a bear, but I think we squeeze it  out.
---
C: (joy): It's night there for a few more hours.  That's a real plus. But I won't lie.  As far as special ops go, this one's  a bear, but I think we squeeze it  out.
R: (joy): Let's get it going.
---
C: (joy): Let's get it going.
R: (neutral): The Press Secretary's about to go  on.
---
C: (fear): If we can get to a lower altitude,  we can use parachutes, but at this  altitude, we'll pass out from Oxygen  deprivation.
R: (neutral): We've already played our cards, Major.  There's no turning back.
---
C: (neutral): We've already played our cards, Major.  There's no turning back.
R: (neutral): We can't jump from here or at this  speed. But if we could get a message  out - tell the refueling plane...
---
C: (neutral): We can't jump from here or at this  speed. But if we could get a message  out - tell the refueling plane...
R: (neutral): They've cut communication, and I  spent a good bit of time looking for  alternatives. My only solution ran  out of batteries.
---
C: (neutral): The fax machines.
R: (anger): Excuse me?
---
C: (anger): Excuse me?
R: (neutral): The fax machines.
---
C: (neutral): The fax machines.
R: (sadness): No good. I said they disabled the  communications system.
---
C: (sadness): No good. I said they disabled the  communications system.
R: (neutral): No. I thought about this, Mr.
---
C: (neutral): Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
R: (neutral): Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two  hundred knots... otherwise it's  suicide.
---
C: (neutral): Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two  hundred knots... otherwise it's  suicide.
R: (neutral): Got it.
---
C: (neutral): Is the President onboard?/ What about  the First Family?/ What are their  demands?
R: (neutral): Please... please... For security  reasons I can not comment on any  specifics except to say that the  Vice-President is doing everything  within her power to resolve the  situation.
---
C: (neutral): Please... please... For security  reasons I can not comment on any  specifics except to say that the  Vice-President is doing everything  within her power to resolve the  situation.
R: (neutral): T.V. monitor on broadcasting CNN.  We're in the...
---
C: (neutral): Where are we sending it?
R: (neutral): White House Situation room.
---
C: (neutral): Someone should give you a raise.
R: (neutral): Actually, sir, you could be that  someone.
---
C: (anger): Nor will there be. My husband does  not negotiate with terrorists.
R: (anger): You will be the first to pay for  that mistake.
---
C: (neutral): Mr. president?  pwtsHALL The fax  went through. We can only wait.
R: (neutral): Your chute.
---
C: (neutral): Your chute.
R: (neutral): I'll not going without my family.
---
C: (neutral): I'll not going without my family.
R: (joy): Yes, sir.
---
C: (anger): Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We  have been instructed to refuel your  plane.
R: (neutral): About goddamn time.

C: (neutral): About goddamn time.
R: (neutral): Please change course to Zero Seven  Four and drop to eighteen thousand  feet. Over.

C: (anger): Air Force One, please reduce speed  to 250 knots.
R: (neutral): Roger.
---
C: (joy): That's affirmative.
R: (neutral): Ga get it.
---
C: (neutral): Sir, we stay with the President.
R: (neutral): That isn't necessary.
---
C: (joy): Relax everybody. I used to do this  for a living9 Caidwell pulls a switch  on the wall.
R: (neutral): Depressurizing compartment. This `11  take a moment.
---
C: (joy): Hey, by the way... who won the Duke  game?
R: (joy): Find out for yourself, sir. I'll  have it waiting at the White House.
---
C: (neutral): Don't move.
R: (joy): Let me save him.
---
C: (neutral): That man, he is the president, no?
R: (neutral): Yes. Yes he is.
---
C: (neutral): They still have the President, it's  past their deadline and they haven't  called. What do you think it means?
R: (joy): Like any good poker player, they're  checking over their hand seeing which  cards to play and which to discard.
---
C: (neutral): He didn't leave us.
R: (joy): You are a resilient man, Mr.
---
C: (neutral): Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do  this?
R: (joy): Yes, Mr. President.
---
C: (joy): Yes, Mr. President.
R: (neutral): Why?
---
C: (neutral): Why?
R: (neutral): Because it is my duty.
---
C: (neutral): Because it is my duty.
R: (sadness): You're duty to what? The country you  served doesn't exist anymore.
---
C: (sadness): You're duty to what? The country you  served doesn't exist anymore.
R: (love): My loyalty was never to my country.
---
C: (neutral): Now since we've had very little luck  getting Washington or Moscow to  cooperate, I wondered if you would  be so kind.
R: (neutral): Over my dead body.
---
C: (neutral): Over my dead body.
R: (anger): No. But since I only have a few of  your staff left to kill, perhaps I  will start with your family instead...  Gibbs.
---
C: (anger): The world is such a dangerous place  and we can't always protect our  children.
R: (neutral): Please. You can kill me but leave my  daughter alone.
---
C: (neutral): She isn't a part of this. This is  between you and me.
R: (neutral): Call up Petrov and order  Stravanavitch' S release.
---
C: (anger): This administration does not negotiate  with terrorists.
R: (neutral): Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
---
C: (neutral): Daddy...
R: (neutral): Alice... I...
---
C: (neutral): Alice... I...
R: (neutral): And once the trigger is pulled, she  is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how  do you live, knowing you could've  saved her?
---
C: (neutral): Daddy. Daddy, please...
R: (neutral): Jim... for godsake!
---
C: (neutral): Jim... for godsake!
R: (sadness): Look inside your heart. No one will  think you weak. Five...

---
C: (sadness): Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
R: (joy): Good. Good.
---
C: (sadness): Someday, you'll regret my nature.
R: (sadness): You don't like seeing people get  hurt. Now in morality, that is a  virtue. In politics, however, that  is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else  *                    long before you  were a hostage to

C: (neutral): I don't know why you stayed.
R: (anger): Please... don't start with me.
---
C: (neutral): You got what you wanted. You going  to release us now?
R: (joy): You're very valuable. And our nation  needs so many things.
---
C: (anger): The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
R: (joy): One thing I've learned as

C: (neutral): Shepherd.
R: (neutral): Sir...
---
C: (neutral): Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
R: (neutral): Both of you.

C: (fear): What is it?
R: (neutral): It's about Stravanvaitch.
---
C: (neutral): It's about Stravanvaitch.
R: (fear): What about him?

C: (fear): What about him?
R: (neutral): He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to  escape.

R: (neutral): This doesn't make sense.
---
C: (neutral): This doesn't make sense.
R: (neutral): How close are they?
---
C: (anger): The Iraqi Ambassador won't take our  calls. We're trying to get through  to their Central Command.
R: (neutral): To tell them what? The great infidel  himself is flying overhead, Go get  him? This is a man they burn in effigy  daily.
---
C: (neutral): To tell them what? The great infidel  himself is flying overhead, Go get  him? This is a man they burn in effigy  daily.
R: (neutral): If challenged, our fighters are to  state that they are on a rescue  mission.
---
C: (neutral): If challenged, our fighters are to  state that they are on a rescue  mission.
R: (neutral): Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're  already in on this or they'll think  we're spying.
---
C: (neutral): Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're  already in on this or they'll think  we're spying.
R: (anger): If fired upon, tell our fighters  that they are ordered to engage.
---
C: (neutral): How you doing, sweetie?
R: (joy): Been better, Dad... You?
---
C: (joy): Halo one, acknowledged.
R: (neutral): Halo two, acknowledged.

C: (joy): There goes your ride.
R: (neutral): Let my daughter go or I'll take you  out!

C: (neutral): Let my daughter go or I'll take you  out!
R: (anger): If you put down the gun, I promise  not to drop her on the way down.
---
C: (neutral): No you won't. You'll compromise...   like always.
R: (joy): Hold on, Alice.
---
C: (neutral): Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
R: (joy): It's okay, honey. I got you. I got  you. You're okay.

C: (fear): The Americans say they are escorting  a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm  they are surrounding a 747.
R: (fear): Did we warn them off?

C: (fear): Did we warn them off?
R: (anger): Yes. They refused to alter course  and the 747 would not answer our  hails.

C: (neutral): It's some kind of trick... a  preliminary airstrike in response to  our troop movement.
R: (neutral): They are in our airspace. We would  be within our rights.

---
C: (neutral): Can you, can you change your heading  to Zero Four One point six?

R: (anger): I prefered the terrorists.
